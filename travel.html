          Bandung's natural wealth never disappoints The cool atmosphere and
          green views in various corners of the highlands in Bandung are very
          suitable as a place to relax the mind. Pesona friends can try visiting
          the beautiful tea gardens in the Ciwidey area and enjoy the fresh air
          freely. If you want a more popular destination, exploring every side
          of the pine forest in Cikole, which is beautiful and spectacular, is
          the answer, Pesona Friends! Apart from that, there is also exciting
          glamping with a choice of stunning natural panoramas, such as at
          Lakeside Rancabali, The Lodge Maribaya, and Trizara Resort. What you
          shouldn't miss, especially if it's not a natural tourist attraction to
          Mount Tangkuban Perahu. Yes! Pesona Friends must witness the beauty of
          the crater which is closely related to the West Javanese folklore
          entitled Sangkuriang. According to the story, the shape of Mount
          Tangkuban Perahu, which looks like an upside down mountain, came from
          a boat made by Sangkuriang which was a requirement for marrying the
          most beautiful girl who turned out to be his mother, Dayang Sumbi.
          However, this condition failed to be fulfilled until Sangkuriang
          kicked the boat until it capsized and according to the story, that was
          the beginning of the creation of Mount Tangkuban Perahu.
