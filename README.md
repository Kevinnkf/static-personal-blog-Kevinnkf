## About the Blog

This blog serves as a platform for me, Kevin Khalfani, to share my personal experiences, interests, and ideas. Whether it's about my academic journey, hobbies, favorite music, or simply things I find intriguing, you'll find a variety of content here. My goal is to create an engaging and informative space for readers.

## Design Choices

### Typography

- **Font Family:** I've chosen a modern and easily readable font family for the blog's text content. It includes system fonts and some commonly available web fonts for improved performance and consistency.

### Color Scheme

- **Background:** The background color is a light shade of blue (#E9F1FA) to provide a comfortable reading experience.

- **Navigation Bar:** The navigation bar has a light gray background (whitesmoke) for contrast with the main content.

- **Accent Colors:** The accent color used for active links and interactive elements is dark green (#006400), providing a clear visual cue.

### Layout

- **Grid Layout:** For a clean and responsive design, I've used CSS Grid for layout management. It ensures that the content adjusts gracefully to various screen sizes.

### Accessibility Features

I'm committed to making this blog accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Here are some of the accessibility features implemented:

- **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better screen reader support.

- **Alt Text:** Images are equipped with descriptive `alt` text to ensure that users with visual impairments can understand their content.

- **ARIA Roles:** ARIA roles and properties have been added to enhance screen reader compatibility and improve the overall user experience.

- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements are navigable and usable via keyboard navigation.

- **Visible Focus Styles:** Clear and visible focus styles have been applied to links and interactive elements to aid keyboard users.
